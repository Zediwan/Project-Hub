# üß™ Neural Network Library

## üîç Overview
A modular, extensible neural network library for C#/.NET projects. Designed for dynamic and evolutionary expansion, it allows the creation and growth of neural networks at runtime‚Äîincluding adding new layers, nodes, and connections. The library includes structural comparison utilities and a visualizer that illustrates the network's architecture and connection properties (positive/negative). It also features evolutionary capabilities, enabling the crossing of two networks to create child networks based on parent structures. Saving and loading of neural networks from files is supported for easy persistence and portability. Distributed as a NuGet package for seamless integration and reusability.

## üîß Core Features
- Dynamic addition and removal of layers, nodes, and connections at runtime
- Evolutionary expansion: mutate structure by adding/removing elements
- Ability to cross (combine) neural networks to produce child networks based on parent structures
- Structural similarity comparison between neural networks
- Visualizer for network architecture and properties (e.g., connection weights, positive/negative links)
- Saving and loading neural networks to and from files (serialization/deserialization)
- Modular, extensible API for adding custom layers and functions
- Integration-ready with any C#/.NET project

## üß† Learning Objectives
- C# class library design and NuGet package creation
- Runtime manipulation of data structures for neural network evolution
- Algorithms for comparing and visualizing neural network structures
- Implementing genetic operations (crossover, mutation) on neural networks
- Serialization and deserialization of complex data structures
- Clean, reusable, and testable code for .NET

## üì¶ Technologies
- C#
- .NET Standard or .NET 6+
- (Optional) Math.NET Numerics for advanced math routines
- (Optional) GUI/graphics library for visualization (e.g., WPF, Avalonia, SkiaSharp)
- NuGet for package distribution

## üí° Stretch Goals
- GPU acceleration (e.g., via external libraries or wrappers)
- Support for additional network types (convolutional, recurrent, etc.)
- Advanced visualization (interactive graphs, animation)
- Plugin system for user-defined layers, activation functions, and visualization themes
- Advanced serialization formats (e.g., JSON, XML, binary) and versioning
