# 🧪 Wave Function Collapse

## 🔍 Overview
Implement and experiment with the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm to procedurally generate tile-based maps, dungeons, and environments using local constraints. This project focuses on understanding how WFC propagates rules through the grid and applying it to creative, playable level design or aesthetic generation.

## 🔧 Core Features
- Rule-based tile map generation using constraints
- Input-based pattern extraction (sample an image or tile set)
- Visualization of the collapsing process step by step

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Understand the WFC algorithm's constraint propagation
- Apply local rule systems to global grid generation
- Implement tile adjacency and rule matching
- Explore stochastic decision-making in map layout

## 📦 Technologies
- C# / Unity / WPF / Python
- Optional: Godot for visual testing
- Custom rule definition formats (e.g., JSON, XML)

## 💡 Stretch Goals
- Build a visual rule editor for tiles and adjacency
- Use WFC to generate rooms with logic (e.g., keys, doors, enemies)
- Combine with other generation methods (e.g., cellular automata or noise)
- Generate images or sprites using pixel-based WFC
