# 🧪 Social Dilemma Games

## 🔍 Overview
Explore multi-agent reinforcement learning through classic social dilemma scenarios such as the Prisoner's Dilemma, Chicken, and Tragedy of the Commons. The goal is to study and simulate cooperative vs. selfish behavior in agents and possibly extend the environments with custom mechanics, agent types, or learning strategies.

## 🔧 Core Features
- Reinforcement learning environments with built-in social dilemmas
- Support for different agent strategies (cooperative, competitive, adaptive)
- Extensible game rules and environments

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Understand the dynamics of social dilemma games in multi-agent systems
- Learn how agents develop behavior based on incentives
- Study emergent behavior in complex group settings

## 📦 Technologies
- Python
- PettingZoo / Gym / Ray RLlib
- Possibly PyTorch or TensorFlow for custom models

## 💡 Stretch Goals
- Add new dilemma variants or mixed-motive tasks
- Enable neural network training with online learning
- Visualize agent behavior and cooperation rates over time
- Add communication or negotiation between agents
