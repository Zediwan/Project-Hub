# 🧪 Evolution Simulation

## 🔍 Overview
A cellular evolution simulation with organisms and DNA.
Big focus on emergent behavior.

## 🔧 Core Features
- Procedural organism evolution
- DNA-based trait control
- Modular simulation loop with UI controls
- Neural Networks for organisms

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Biological simulation design
- C# architecture
- Mutation systems

## 📦 Technologies
- C# / .NET 8 / WPF

## 💡 Stretch Goals
- Visualize evolutionary trees
- Add real-time graphs and stats
