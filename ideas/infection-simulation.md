# 🧪 Infection Simulation With Neural Agents

## 🔍 Overview
Simulates infection spreading across agents powered by neural networks, influenced by environmental factors like cities, climate, laws, and infrastructure.

## 🔧 Core Features
- Neural-network-driven agents
- Infection, immunity, and recovery states
- Cities, airports, countries, and legal systems / laws based on infections

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Multi-agent systems
- State machines
- Environment-aware movement

## 📦 Technologies
- Python / Neural Networks / Simulation frameworks

## 💡 Stretch Goals
- Add vaccination systems
- Introduce dynamic climate events
