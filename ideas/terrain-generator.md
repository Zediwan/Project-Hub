# 🧪 Procedural Terrain Generator

## 🔍 Overview
Generate 2D or 3D terrains using noise functions, erosion, heightmaps, and biome classification. Useful for world-building, games, or scientific simulations.

## 🔧 Core Features
- Noise-based heightmap generation
- Terrain classification (biomes, moisture, elevation)
- Exportable maps and mesh generation

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Understand Perlin/Simplex noise
- Terrain topology generation
- Mesh and texture generation

## 📦 Technologies
- C# / Unity / Godot / Python / Rust

## 💡 Stretch Goals
- Add real-time terrain editing tools
- Integrate erosion simulation
- Create tiling terrain for infinite worlds
