# 🧪 Neural Network Agent Driving Simulation

## 🔍 Overview
A driving simulation where an agent learns to control a vehicle using neural networks. Inspired by [GPUDrive](https://github.com/Emerge-Lab/gpudrive), this project aims to explore end-to-end learning, control systems, and reinforcement learning in a continuous environment.

## 🔧 Core Features
- Simulated driving physics (steering, acceleration, braking)
- Agent controlled via a neural network
- Reward-based learning (e.g., distance, staying on track)

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Learn how to apply neural networks to control problems
- Explore perception-action loops in simulation
- Understand reward shaping and exploration-exploitation tradeoffs

## 📦 Technologies
- Unity (or a Python simulation engine)
- PyTorch / TensorFlow
- Reinforcement learning frameworks (e.g., Stable Baselines, Ray RLlib)

## 💡 Stretch Goals
- Add multiple driving behaviors (e.g., racing, cautious, aggressive)
- Introduce traffic systems or pedestrian agents
- Use real-world road data or physics calibration
